Here are some tips for using LLMs to generate ideas:

- Be as specific as possible in your prompts. The more specific you are, the better the LLM will 
be able to understand what you are asking for.
- Use keywords in your prompts. This will help the LLM to generate ideas that are relevant to your topic.
- Try different temperatures and top_p values. These parameters control the creativity and diversity of the generated ideas.
- Experiment with different prompts and settings to see what works best for you.
