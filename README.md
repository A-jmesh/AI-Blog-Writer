## Introduction

Given high level domain keywords like "Fishing baits online" Or any 2-3 main key words that describe, broadly, your business.
This tool will produce a SEO optimized blogs. This tool will suggest most popular blog topics, divide them in sub topics and write content for each sub topic. For each of the paragraphs, we summarise it and pass the line for text to image.
Thus, the generated blog will have text and relevant images.

(TBD) Provide the blog output as plain text, markdown Or HTML.

Presently, wordpress and WIX integration is present for uploading the generated blog, but needs testing.


This is based on openai gpt models for content generation, google bard for keyword research and some basic tools for plagiarism checker, SEO audit and suggestions to improve the generated content.
As prompts are the important ingredients to get the best result, they are stored in prompts folder. Edit these prompts to produce results as per your likings.

API based blog generation are much cheaper, almost 10x, but difficult to use for everyone. We use bard for search related prompts and chatgpt for generative requirements.

Check TBD for features currently under development.
